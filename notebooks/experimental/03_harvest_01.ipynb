We measure structural\\nand textual features of conversations such as user output, interaction, and\\ninformation content per message across a wide range of information loads.

The\\nconventional optimization-based models suffer several limitations: strict\\nassumption of shared sparse support, time-consuming optimization and \"shallow\"\\nmodels with difficulties in encoding the rich patterns hiding in massive MRI\\ndata. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning model for\\nmulti-contrast MRI reconstruction.

These inference blocks are cascaded with dense connections,\\nwhich allows for information transmission across different depths of the\\nnetwork efficiently. Our extensive experiments on various multi-contrast MRI\\ndatasets show that proposed model outperforms both state-of-the-art\\nsingle-contrast and multi-contrast MRI methods in accuracy and efficiency.

The task of FSFG requires the learning systems\\nto build classifiers for novel fine-grained categories from few examples (only\\none or less than five).

Due to\\nchanging availability of tasks and agents, planning ahead is infeasible and\\neach cycle is an independent assignment problem but influenced by previous\\nchoices.

We also show that, in great\\ngenerality, SVF is asymptotically optimal, i.e., the ratio approaches 1 as the\\nnumber of patients grows large.

In this contribution, we propose an SA system, namely\\nEvoMSA, that unifies our participating systems in various SA competitions,\\nmaking it domain independent and multilingual by processing text using only\\nlanguage-independent techniques. EvoMSA is a classifier, based on Genetic\\nProgramming, that works by combining the output of different text classifiers\\nand text models to produce the final prediction.

We derive exact and approximate expressions\\nfor the expected unit and linear costs of SSR, SSC, and SSS on Erdos-Renyi (ER)\\ngraphs. Our results show there is i) little difference in unit cost, but ii)\\nsignificant difference in linear cost, across the three paradigms.

       "  'abstract': '  It has been noted in existing literature that over-parameterization in ReLU\\nnetworks generally improves performance. While there could be several factors\\ninvolved behind this, we prove some desirable theoretical properties at\\ninitialization which may be enjoyed by ReLU networks. Specifically, it is known\\nthat He initialization in deep ReLU networks asymptotically preserves variance\\nof activations in the forward pass and variance of gradients in the backward\\npass for infinitely wide networks, thus preserving the flow of information in\\nboth directions. Our paper goes beyond these results and shows novel properties\\nthat hold under He initialization: i) the norm of hidden activation of each\\nlayer is equal to the norm of the input, and, ii) the norm of weight gradient\\nof each layer is equal to the product of norm of the input vector and the error\\nat output layer. These results are derived using the PAC analysis framework,\\nand hold true for finitely sized datasets such that the width of the ReLU\\nnetwork only needs to be larger than a certain finite lower bound. As we show,\\nthis lower bound depends on the depth of the network and the number of samples,\\nand by the virtue of being a lower bound, over-parameterized ReLU networks are\\nendowed with these desirable properties. For the aforementioned hidden\\nactivation norm property under He initialization, we further extend our theory\\nand show that this property holds for a finite width network even when the\\nnumber of data samples is infinite. Thus we overcome several limitations of\\nexisting papers, and show new properties of deep ReLU networks at\\ninitialization.\\n',\n",

For imaging\\napplications, it is important to have a CAT that can operate on any real color\\nand illuminant pair without failure. This paper proposes a new CAT that does\\nnot operate on the standard von Kries model of adaptation. Instead it relies on\\nspectral reconstruction and how these reconstructions behave with respect to\\ndifferent illuminants. It is demonstrated that the proposed CAT is immune to\\nsome of the limitations of existing CATs (such as producing colors with\\nnegative tristimulus values). The proposed CAT does not use established\\nempirical corresponding-color datasets to optimize performance, as most modern\\nCATs do, yet it performs as well as or better than the most recent CATs when\\ntested against the corresponding-color datasets. This increase in robustness\\ncomes at the expense of additional complexity and computational effort. If\\nrobustness is of prime importance, then the proposed method may be justifiable.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  As a supervised classification method, least square regression (LSR) has\\nshown promising performance in multiclass face recognition tasks. However, the\\nlatest LSR based classification methods mainly focus on learning a relaxed\\nregression target to replace traditional zero-one label matrix while ignoring\\nthe discriminability of transformed features. Based on the assumption that the\\ntransformed features of samples from the same class have similar structure\\nwhile those of samples from different classes are uncorrelated, in this paper\\nwe propose a novel discriminative LSR method based on the Fisher discrimination\\ncriterion (FDLSR), where the projected features have small within-class scatter\\nand large inter-class scatter simultaneously. Moreover, different from other\\nmethods, we explore relax regression from the view of transformed features\\nrather than the regression targets. Specifically, we impose a dynamic\\nnon-negative weight matrix on the transformed features to enlarge the margin\\nbetween the true and the false classes by self-adaptively assigning appropriate\\nweights to different features. Above two factors can encourage the learned\\ntransformation for regression to be more discriminative and thus achieving\\nbetter classification performance. Extensive experiments on various databases\\ndemonstrate that the proposed FDLSR method achieves superior performance to\\nother state-of-the-art LSR based classification methods.\\n',\n",

Primarily driven by confirmation bias, users tend to join\\nhomogeneous and polarized clusters (echo chambers) where they cooperate to\\nframe and reinforce a like-minded system of beliefs, thus facilitating\\nmisinformation cascades. To gain a deeper understanding of these phenomena, in\\nthis work we analyze the lexicons used by the communities of users emerging on\\nFacebook around two very conflicting narratives: science and conspiracy. We\\nshow how the words exhibiting a significant differentiation in frequency from\\none community to another, provide important insights about the kind of\\ninformation processed by the two groups of users and about the overall\\nsentiment expressed in their comments.

A fundamental step to incorporating Twitter data in\\npharmacoepidemiological research is to automatically recognize medication\\nmentions in tweets. Given that lexical searches for medication names may fail\\ndue to misspellings or ambiguity with common words, we propose a more advanced\\nmethod to recognize them. Methods: We present Kusuri, an Ensemble Learning\\nclassifier, able to identify tweets mentioning drug products and dietary\\nsupplements. Kusuri (\"medication\" in Japanese) is composed of two modules.\\nFirst, four different classifiers (lexicon-based, spelling-variant-based,\\npattern-based and one based on a weakly-trained neural network) are applied in\\nparallel to discover tweets potentially containing medication names. Second, an\\nensemble of deep neural networks encoding morphological, semantical and\\nlong-range dependencies of important words in the tweets discovered is used to\\nmake the final decision. Results: On a balanced (50-50) corpus of 15,005\\ntweets, Kusuri demonstrated performances close to human annotators with 93.7%\\nF1-score, the best score achieved thus far on this corpus. On a corpus made of\\nall tweets posted by 113 Twitter users (98,959 tweets, with only 0.26%\\nmentioning medications), Kusuri obtained 76.3% F1-score.

Labeled\\nfailures are a conservative extension of PEGs that adds an error reporting\\nmechanism for PEG parsers, and these labels can also be associated with\\nrecovery expressions to provide an error recovery mechanism. These expressions\\ncan use the full expressivity of PEGs to recover from syntactic errors.\\n  Manually annotating a large grammar with labels and recovery expressions can\\nbe difficult. In this work, we present two approaches, Standard and Unique, to\\nautomatically annotate a PEG with labels, and to build their corresponding\\nrecovery expressions. The Standard approach annotates a grammar in a way\\nsimilar to manual annotation, but it may insert labels incorrectly, while the\\nUnique approach is more conservative to annotate a grammar and does not insert\\nlabels incorrectly.\\n  We evaluate both approaches by using them to generate error recovering\\nparsers for four programming languages: Titan, C, Pascal and Java. In our\\nevaluation, the parsers produced using the Standard approach, after a manual\\nintervention to remove the labels incorrectly added, gave an acceptable\\nrecovery for at least 70% of the files in each language. By it turn, the\\nacceptable recovery rate of the parsers produced via the Unique approach,\\nwithout the need of manual intervention, ranged from 41% to 76%.\\n',\n",

In this paper, we present DISN, a Deep Implicit Surface\\nNetwork which can generate a high-quality detail-rich 3D mesh from an 2D image\\nby predicting the underlying signed distance fields. In addition to utilizing\\nglobal image features, DISN predicts the projected location for each 3D point\\non the 2D image, and extracts local features from the image feature maps.\\nCombining global and local features significantly improves the accuracy of the\\nsigned distance field prediction, especially for the detail-rich areas.

While generalizing well\\nover natural inputs, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial inputs -an\\ninput that is ``similar'' to the original input, but misclassified by the\\nmodel.\\n  Existing defenses focus on Lp-norm bounded adversaries that perturb ML inputs\\nin the digital space. In the real world, however, attackers can generate\\nadversarial perturbations that have a large Lp-norm in the digital space.\\nAdditionally, these defenses also come at a cost to accuracy, making their\\napplicability questionable in the real world.\\n  To defend models against such a powerful adversary, we leverage one\\nconstraint on its power: the perturbation should not change the human's\\nperception of the physical information; the physical world places some\\nconstraints on the space of possible attacks. Two questions follow: how to\\nextract and model these constraints? and how to design a classification\\nparadigm that leverages these constraints to improve robustness accuracy\\ntrade-off?\\n  We observe that an ML model is typically a part of a larger system with\\naccess to different input modalities. Utilizing these modalities, we introduce\\ninvariants that limit the attacker's action space. We design a hierarchical\\nclassification paradigm that enforces these invariants at inference time.\\n  As a case study, we implement and evaluate our proposal in the context of the\\nreal-world application of road sign classification because of its applicability\\nto autonomous driving. With access to different input modalities, such as\\nLiDAR, camera, and location we show how to extract invariants and develop a\\nhierarchical classifier. Our results on the KITTI and GTSRB datasets show that\\nwe can improve the robustness against physical attacks at minimal harm to\\naccuracy.\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Predictive coding theories suggest that the brain learns by predicting\\nobservations at various levels of abstraction. One of the most basic prediction\\ntasks is view prediction: how would a given scene look from an alternative\\nviewpoint? Humans excel at this task. Our ability to imagine and fill in\\nmissing visual information is tightly coupled with perception: we feel as if we\\nsee the world in 3 dimensions, while in fact, information from only the front\\nsurface of the world hits our (2D) retinas. This paper explores the connection\\nbetween view-predictive representation learning and its role in the development\\nof 3D visual recognition. We propose inverse graphics networks, which take as\\ninput 2.5D video streams captured by a moving camera, and map to stable 3D\\nfeature maps of the scene, by disentangling the scene content from the motion\\nof the camera. The model can also project its 3D feature maps to novel\\nviewpoints, to predict and match against target views. We propose contrastive\\nprediction losses that can handle stochasticity of the visual input and can\\nscale view-predictive learning to more photorealistic scenes than those\\nconsidered in previous works. We show that the proposed model learns 3D visual\\nrepresentations useful for (1) semi-supervised learning of 3D object detectors,\\nand (2) unsupervised learning of 3D moving object detectors, by estimating\\nmotion of the inferred 3D feature maps in videos of dynamic scenes. To the best\\nof our knowledge, this is the first work that empirically shows view prediction\\nto be a useful and scalable self-supervised task beneficial to 3D object\\ndetection.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  The Internet is a complex ecosystem composed of thousands of Autonomous\\nSystems (ASs) operated by independent organizations; each AS having a very\\nlimited view outside its own network. These complexities and limitations impede\\nnetwork operators to finely pinpoint the causes of service degradation or\\ndisruption when the problem lies outside of their network. In this paper, we\\npresent Chocolatine, a solution to detect remote connectivity loss using\\nInternet Background Radiation (IBR) through a simple and efficient method. IBR\\nis unidirectional unsolicited Internet traffic, which is easily observed by\\nmonitoring unused address space. IBR features two remarkable properties: it is\\noriginated worldwide, across diverse ASs, and it is incessant. We show that the\\nnumber of IP addresses observed from an AS or a geographical area follows a\\nperiodic pattern. Then, using Seasonal ARIMA to statistically model IBR data,\\nwe predict the number of IPs for the next time window. Significant deviations\\nfrom these predictions indicate an outage.

Our experiments show that the proposed methodology achieves a good\\ntrade-off between true-positive rate (90%) and false-positive rate (2%) and\\nlargely outperforms CAIDA's own IBR-based detection method. Furthermore,\\nperforming a comparison against other methods, i.e., with BGP monitoring and\\nactive probing, we observe that Chocolatine shares a large common set of\\noutages with them in addition to many specific outages that would otherwise go\\nundetected.\\n\",\n",

Thirty-six\\nadults walked on a treadmill equipped with a force platform that recorded the\\npositions of the center of pressure. The raw two-dimensional signals were\\nsliced into segments of two gait cycles. A set of 20,250 segments from 30\\nsubjects was used to configure and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\\nThe best CNN classified a separate set containing 2,250 segments with 99.9%\\noverall accuracy. A second set of 4,500 segments from the six remaining\\nsubjects was then used for transfer learning. Several small subsamples of this\\nset were selected randomly and used for fine tuning. Training with two segments\\nper subject was sufficient to achieve 100% accuracy. The results suggest that\\nevery person produces a unique trajectory of underfoot pressures and that CNNs\\ncan learn the distinctive features of these trajectories.

The decomposition is performed in such a way that\\nthe bipedal walking gaits and controllers can be composed to yield dynamic\\nwalking gaits for the original quadrupedal robot --- the result, therefore, is\\nthe rapid generation of dynamic quadruped gaits utilizing the full-order\\ndynamics. This methodology is demonstrated through the rapid generation (3.96\\nseconds on average) of four stepping-in-place gaits and one ambling gait at\\n0.35 m/s on a quadrupedal robot --- the Vision 60, with 36 state variables and\\n12 control inputs --- both in simulation and through outdoor experiments. This\\nsuggested a new approach for fast quadrupedal trajectory planning using\\nfull-body dynamics, without the need for empirical model simplification,\\nwherein methods from dynamic bipedal walking can be directly applied to\\nquadrupeds.\\n',\n",

However, this improvement\\nsaturates and starts degrading after a few rounds of interaction, and does not\\nlead to a better Visual Dialog model. We find that this is due in part to\\nrepeated interactions between Qbot and Abot during self-talk, which are not\\ninformative with respect to the image. To improve this, we devise a simple\\nauxiliary objective that incentivizes Qbot to ask diverse questions, thus\\nreducing repetitions and in turn enabling Abot to explore a larger state space\\nduring RL ie. be exposed to more visual concepts to talk about, and varied\\nquestions to answer. We evaluate our approach via a host of automatic metrics\\nand human studies, and demonstrate that it leads to better dialog, ie. dialog\\nthat is more diverse (ie. less repetitive), consistent (ie. has fewer\\nconflicting exchanges), fluent (ie. more human-like),and detailed, while still\\nbeing comparably image-relevant as prior work and ablations.\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanism have\\nachieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks such as machine translation\\nand speech synthesis. These models can be difficult to train. The standard\\napproach, teacher forcing, guides a model with reference output history during\\ntraining. The problem is that the model is unlikely to recover from its\\nmistakes during inference, where the reference output is replaced by generated\\noutput. Several approaches deal with this problem, largely by guiding the model\\nwith generated output history. To make training stable, these approaches often\\nrequire a heuristic schedule or an auxiliary classifier. This paper introduces\\nattention forcing, which guides the model with generated output history and\\nreference attention. This approach can train the model to recover from its\\nmistakes, in a stable fashion, without the need for a schedule or a classifier.\\nIn addition, it allows the model to generate output sequences aligned with the\\nreferences, which can be important for cascaded systems like many speech\\nsynthesis systems. Experiments on speech synthesis show that attention forcing\\nyields significant performance gain. Experiments on machine translation show\\nthat for tasks where various re-orderings of the output are valid, guiding the\\nmodel with generated output history is challenging, while guiding the model\\nwith reference attention is beneficial.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Demand-Side Management (DSM) is a vital tool that can be used to ensure power\\nsystem reliability and stability. In future smart grids, certain portions of a\\ncustomers load usage could be under automatic control with a cyber-enabled DSM\\nprogram which selectively schedules loads as a function of electricity prices\\nto improve power balance and grid stability. In such a case, the security of\\nDSM cyberinfrastructure will be critical as advanced metering infrastructure,\\nand communication systems are susceptible to hacking, cyber-attacks. Such\\nattacks, in the form of data injection, can manipulate customer load profiles\\nand cause metering chaos and energy losses in the grid. These attacks are also\\nexacerbated by the feedback mechanism between load management on the consumer\\nside and dynamic price schemes by independent system operators. This work\\nprovides a novel methodology for modeling and simulating the nonlinear\\nrelationship between load management and real-time pricing. We then investigate\\nthe behavior of such a feedback loop under intentional cyber-attacks using our\\nfeedback model. We simulate and examine load-price data under different levels\\nof DSM participation with three types of additive attacks: ramp, sudden, and\\npoint attacks. We apply change point and supervised learning methods for\\ndetection of DSM attacks. Results conclude that while higher levels of DSM\\nparticipation can exacerbate attacks they also lead to better detection of such\\nattacks. Further analysis of results shows that point attacks are the hardest\\nto detect and supervised learning methods produce results on par or better than\\nsequential detectors.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  A variety of queries about stochastic systems boil down to study of Markov\\nchains and their properties. If the Markov chain is large, as is typically true\\nfor discretized continuous spaces, such analysis may be computationally\\nintractable. Nevertheless, in many scenarios, Markov chains have underlying\\nstructural properties that allow them to admit a low-dimensional\\nrepresentation. For instance, the transition matrix associated with the model\\nmay be low-rank and hence, representable in a lower-dimensional space. We\\nconsider the problem of learning low-dimensional representations for\\nlarge-scale Markov chains. To that end, we formulate the task of representation\\nlearning as that of mapping the state space of the model to a low-dimensional\\nstate space, referred to as the kernel space. The kernel space contains a set\\nof meta states which are desired to be representative of only a small subset of\\noriginal states. To promote this structural property, we constrain the number\\nof nonzero entries of the mappings between the state space and the kernel\\nspace. By imposing the desired characteristics of the structured\\nrepresentation, we cast the problem as the task of nonnegative matrix\\nfactorization. To compute the solution, we propose an efficient block\\ncoordinate gradient descent and theoretically analyze its convergence\\nproperties. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the\\nproposed algorithm in terms of the quality of the low-dimensional\\nrepresentation as well as its computational cost.\\n',\n",

Yet, they cannot preserve all structures\\nsimultaneously and they induce some unavoidable distortions. Hence, many\\ncriteria have been introduced to evaluate a map's overall quality, mostly based\\non the preservation of neighbourhoods. Such global indicators are currently\\nused to compare several maps, which helps to choose the most appropriate\\nmapping method and its hyperparameters. However, those aggregated indicators\\ntend to hide the local repartition of distortions. Thereby, they need to be\\nsupplemented by local evaluation to ensure correct interpretation of maps. In\\nthis paper, we describe a new method, called MING, for `Map Interpretation\\nusing Neighbourhood Graphs'. It offers a graphical interpretation of pairs of\\nmap quality indicators, as well as local evaluation of the distortions. This is\\ndone by displaying on the map the nearest neighbours graphs computed in the\\ndata space and in the embedding.

DBSE relies fundamentally on UDP and TCP\\nnetwork communications protocols and implements a subset of the FIX de facto\\nstandard protocol for financial information exchange. We show results from an\\nexample in which the exchange server is remotely launched on a cloud facility\\nlocated in London (UK), with trader clients running in Ohio (USA) and Sydney\\n(Australia). We close with discussion of how our simulator could be further\\nused to study planetary-scale latency arbitrage in financial markets.\\n',\n",

Instead of\\nannotated images, our method only requires two short videos to learn to detect\\na new object: 1) a video of a moving object and 2) one or more \"negative\"\\nvideos of the scene without the object. The key idea of our algorithm is to\\ntrain the object detector to produce physically plausible object motion when\\napplied to the first video and to not detect anything in the second video. With\\nthis approach, our method learns to locate objects without any object location\\nannotations. Once the model is trained, it performs object detection on single\\nimages. We evaluate our method in three robotics settings that afford learning\\nobjects from motion: observing moving objects, watching demonstrations of\\nobject manipulation, and physically interacting with objects (see a video\\nsummary at https://youtu.be/BH0Hv3zZG_4).\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  The application of standard sufficient dimension reduction methods for\\nreducing the dimension space of predictors without losing regression\\ninformation requires inverting the covariance matrix of the predictors. This\\nhas posed a number of challenges especially when analyzing high-dimensional\\ndata sets in which the number of predictors $\\\\mathit{p}$ is much larger than\\nnumber of samples $n,~(n\\\\ll p)$. A new covariance estimator, called the\\n\\\\textit{Maximum Entropy Covariance} (MEC) that addresses loss of covariance\\ninformation when similar covariance matrices are linearly combined using\\n\\\\textit{Maximum Entropy} (ME) principle is proposed in this work. By\\nbenefitting naturally from slicing or discretizing range of the response\\nvariable, y into \\\\textit{H} non-overlapping categories, $\\\\mathit{h_{1},\\\\ldots\\n,h_{H}}$, MEC first combines covariance matrices arising from samples in each y\\nslice $\\\\mathit{h\\\\in H}$ and then select the one that maximizes entropy under\\nthe principle of maximum uncertainty. The MEC estimator is then formed from\\nconvex mixture of such entropy-maximizing sample covariance $S_{\\\\mbox{mec}}$\\nestimate and pooled sample covariance $\\\\mathbf{S}_{\\\\mathit{p}}$ estimate across\\nthe $\\\\mathit{H}$ slices without requiring time-consuming covariance\\noptimization procedures. MEC deals directly with singularity and instability of\\nsample group covariance estimate in both regression and classification\\nproblems. The efficiency of the MEC estimator is studied with the existing\\nsufficient dimension reduction methods such as \\\\textit{Sliced Inverse\\nRegression} (SIR) and \\\\textit{Sliced Average Variance Estimator} (SAVE) as\\ndemonstrated on both classification and regression problems using real life\\nLeukemia cancer data and customers' electricity load profiles from smart meter\\ndata sets respectively.\\n\",\n",

This paper aims to\\nquantify the influence of CAVs on HVs by studying the high-resolution vehicle\\ntrajectory data that is obtained from microscopic simulation. Two clustering\\nstrategies for CACC are implemented: an ad hoc coordination one and a local\\ncoordination one.

In order to overcome the huge force variation due to the adjoining\\nFloating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) and accommodation vessel, a\\nnovel sea state observer is designed. The sea observer can effectively monitor\\nthe variation of the drift wave-induced force on the vessel and activate Neural\\nNetwork (NN) compensator in the controller when large wave force is identified.\\nMoreover, the wind drag coefficients can be adaptively approximated in the sea\\nobserver so that a feedforward control can be achieved. Based on this, a robust\\nconstrained control is developed to guarantee a safe operation. The time delay\\ninside the control input is also considered. Dynamic thrust allocation module\\nis presented to distribute the generalized control input among azimuth\\nthrusters.

Recent works on extremely-low-bit CNNs\\nsuch as the binary neural network (BNN) and XNOR-Net replace the traditional\\nfloating-point operations with binary bit operations which significantly\\nreduces the memory bandwidth and storage requirement. However, it suffers from\\nnon-negligible accuracy loss and underutilized digital signal processing (DSP)\\nblocks of FPGAs. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes REQ-YOLO, a\\nresource-aware, systematic weight quantization framework for object detection,\\nconsidering both algorithm and hardware resource aspects in object detection.\\nWe adopt the block-circulant matrix method and propose a heterogeneous weight\\nquantization using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), an\\neffective optimization technique for general, non-convex optimization problems.\\nTo achieve real-time, highly-efficient implementations on FPGA, we present the\\ndetailed hardware implementation of block circulant matrices on CONV layers and\\ndevelop an efficient processing element (PE) structure supporting the\\nheterogeneous weight quantization, CONV dataflow and pipelining techniques,\\ndesign optimization, and a template-based automatic synthesis framework to\\noptimally exploit hardware resource. Experimental results show that our\\nproposed REQ-YOLO framework can significantly compress the YOLO model while\\nintroducing very small accuracy degradation.\\n',\n",

This\\npaper considers a novel variational formulation of network embeddings, with\\nspecial focus on textual networks. Different from most existing methods that\\noptimize a discriminative objective, we introduce Variational Homophilic\\nEmbedding (VHE), a fully generative model that learns network embeddings by\\nmodeling the semantic (textual) information with a variational autoencoder,\\nwhile accounting for the structural (topology) information through a novel\\nhomophilic prior design. Homophilic vertex embeddings encourage similar\\nembedding vectors for related (connected) vertices. The proposed VHE promises\\nbetter generalization for downstream tasks, robustness to incomplete\\nobservations, and the ability to generalize to unseen vertices. Extensive\\nexperiments on real-world networks, for multiple tasks, demonstrate that the\\nproposed method consistently achieves superior performance relative to\\ncompeting state-of-the-art approaches.\\n',\n",

Furthermore, we propose the ip-NSW+ algorithm, which improves\\nip-NSW by introducing an additional angular proximity graph. Search is first\\nconducted on the angular graph to find the angular neighbors of a query and\\nthen the MIPS neighbors of these angular neighbors are used to initialize the\\ncandidate pool for search on the inner-product proximity graph.

However, point-clouds are stored in irregular and unordered structures,\\nwhich limits the direct use of segmentation algorithms such as Convolutional\\nNeural Networks. The objective of our work is twofold: First, we aim to provide\\na full analysis of the PointNet architecture to illustrate which features are\\nbeing extracted from the point-clouds. Second, to propose a new network\\narchitecture called IPC-Net to improve the state-of-the-art point cloud\\narchitectures. We show that IPC-Net extracts a larger set of unique features\\nallowing the model to produce more accurate segmentations compared to the\\nPointNet architecture. In general, our approach outperforms PointNet on every\\nfamily of 3D geometries on which the models were tested. A high generalisation\\nimprovement was observed on every 3D shape, especially on the rockets dataset.\\nOur experiments demonstrate that our main contribution, inter-point activation\\non the network's layers, is essential to accurately segment 3D point-clouds.\\n\",\n",

In this work, we present\\na model-agnostic method to achieve high quality in processing incrementally\\nproduced partial utterances. Based on clean and noisy versions of the ATIS\\ndataset, we show how to create datasets with our method to create low-latency\\nnatural language understanding components.

This paper\\npresents a coarse-to-fine registration method of aerial/satellite optical\\nimagery with airborne LiDAR data acquired in such context. Firstly, a coarse\\nregistration involves extracting and matching of buildings from LiDAR data and\\noptical imagery. Then, a Mutual Information-based fine registration is carried\\nout.

To address this need\\nfor a class of problems, we introduce a novel mechanism that privatizes vectors\\nbelonging to the unit simplex. Such vectors can be seen in many applications,\\nsuch as privatizing a decision-making policy in a Markov decision process. We\\nuse differential privacy as the underlying mathematical framework for these\\ndevelopments. The introduced mechanism is a probabilistic mapping that maps a\\nvector within the unit simplex to the same domain according to a Dirichlet\\ndistribution. We find the mechanism well-suited for inputs within the unit\\nsimplex because it always returns a privatized output that is also in the unit\\nsimplex. Therefore, no further projection back onto the unit simplex is\\nrequired. We verify the privacy guarantees of the mechanism for two cases,\\nnamely, identity queries and average queries. In the former case, we derive\\nexpressions for the differential privacy level of privatizing a single vector\\nwithin the unit simplex. In the latter case, we study the mechanism for\\nprivatizing the average of a collection of vectors, each of which is in the\\nunit simplex.

One of the concepts for achieving this\\nrequirement is the design of resilient and survivable digital embedded systems.\\nIn the last two decades, development of self-healing digital systems based on\\nmolecular and cellular biology have received attention for the design of robust\\ndigital systems.

The proposed architecture is\\nintegrating cellular-based biological concepts, traditional fault tolerance\\ntechniques, and operational schematics for the international standard IEC\\n61131-3 to facilitate adoption in the automation industry and safety-critical\\napplications. To date, two industrial applications have been mapped on the\\nproposed architecture, which are capable of tolerating a significant number of\\nfaults that can stem from harsh environmental changes and external disturbances\\nand we believe the nexus of its concepts can positively impact the next\\ngeneration of critical systems in the automation industry\\n',\n",

To do so, we\\npropose a regularization approach based on IB, called Entropy Penalty, that\\nreduces the model's dependence on spurious features-- features corresponding to\\nsuch spurious correlations. This allows deep networks trained with Entropy\\nPenalty to generalize well even under distribution shift of spurious features.\\nAs a controlled test-bed for evaluating our claim, we train deep networks with\\nEntropy Penalty on a colored MNIST (C-MNIST) dataset and show that it is able\\nto generalize well on vanilla MNIST, MNIST-M and SVHN datasets in addition to\\nan OOD version of C-MNIST itself. The baseline regularization methods we\\ncompare against fail to generalize on this test-bed. Our code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/salesforce/EntropyPenalty.\\n\",\n",

Decision forests are typically ensembles of axis-aligned\\ndecision trees; that is, trees that split only along feature dimensions. In\\ncontrast, many recent extensions to decision forests are based on axis-oblique\\nsplits. Unfortunately, these extensions forfeit one or more of the favorable\\nproperties of decision forests based on axis-aligned splits, such as robustness\\nto many noise dimensions, interpretability, or computational efficiency. We\\nintroduce yet another decision forest, called \\\"Sparse Projection Oblique\\nRandomer Forests\\\" (SPORF). SPORF uses very sparse random projections, i.e.,\\nlinear combinations of a small subset of features. SPORF significantly improves\\naccuracy over existing state-of-the-art algorithms on a standard benchmark\\nsuite for classification with >100 problems of varying dimension, sample size,\\nand number of classes. To illustrate how SPORF addresses the limitations of\\nboth axis-aligned and existing oblique decision forest methods, we conduct\\nextensive simulated experiments. SPORF typically yields improved performance\\nover existing decision forests, while mitigating computational efficiency and\\nscalability and maintaining interpretability. SPORF can easily be incorporated\\ninto other ensemble methods such as boosting to obtain potentially similar\\ngains.\\n\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML cs.LG\"}\n",
