Inspired by advances in attention and set-input machine learning, we present a novel architecture that can generate in one forward pass image collages of source templates using set-structured representations.

The test campaign was divided into two stages: a first two years long offline test, and a second one year long real-time test. The offline test used historical faults from six wind farms located in Italy and Romania, corresponding to a total of 150 wind turbines and an overall installed nominal power of 283 MW. The results demonstrate outstanding capabilities of anomaly prediction up to 2 months before device unscheduled downtime. Furthermore, the real-time 12-months test confirms the ability of the proposed system to detect several anomalies, therefore allowing the operators to identify the root causes, and to schedule maintenance actions before reaching a catastrophic stage.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Machine learning is yielding unprecedented interest in research and industry, due to recent success in many applied contexts such as image classification and object recognition. However, the deployment of these systems requires huge computing capabilities, thus making them unsuitable for embedded systems. To deal with this limitation, many researchers are investigating brain-inspired computing, which would be a perfect alternative to the conventional Von Neumann architecture based computers (CPU/GPU) that meet the requirements for computing performance, but not for energy-efficiency. Therefore, neuromorphic hardware circuits that are adaptable for both parallel and distributed computations need to be designed. In this paper, we focus on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with a comprehensive study of information coding methods and hardware exploration. In this context, we propose a framework for neuromorphic hardware design space exploration, which allows to define a suitable architecture based on application-specific constraints and starting from a wide variety of possible architectural choices. For this framework, we have developed a behavioral level simulator for neuromorphic hardware architectural exploration named NAXT. Moreover, we propose modified versions of the standard Rate Coding technique to make trade-offs with the Time Coding paradigm, which is characterized by the low number of spikes propagating in the network. Thus, we are able to reduce the number of spikes while keeping the same neuron's model, which results in an SNN with fewer events to process. By doing so, we seek to reduce the amount of power consumed by the hardware. Furthermore, we present three neuromorphic hardware architectures in order to quantitatively study the implementation of SNNs. These architectures are derived from a novel funnel-like Design Space Exploration framework for neuromorphic hardware.\",\n",

First, we probe BERT's ability to classify various object attributes, demonstrating that BERT shows a strong ability in encoding various commonsense features in its embedding space, but is still deficient in many areas. Next, we show that, by augmenting BERT's pretraining data with additional data related to the deficient attributes, we are able to improve performance on a downstream commonsense reasoning task while using a minimal amount of data. Finally, we develop a method of fine-tuning knowledge graphs embeddings alongside BERT and show the continued importance of explicit knowledge graphs.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Far right actors use the Internet for myriad purposes, such as forming communities, sharing information and attracting support. Concerns have been raised about their use of social media to spread hateful messages by both academics and policymakers. Given the potentially dangerous effects of hate speech, which can inflict harm on targeted victims, create a sense of fear amongst communities and pollute civic discourse, there is a pressing need to understand at a granular level how it manifests amongst far right actors online. In this paper we investigate the dynamics of Islamophobia amongst followers of a far right political party on Twitter, the British National Party. Using a new dataset of five million tweets, collected over a period of one year, we identify seven distinct trajectories of Islamophobia, which capture qualitative, qualitative and temporal differences in users' behaviour. We analyse the data using a classifier for Islamophobic content, which distinguishes between None, Implicit and Explicit Islamophobia, and latent Markov modelling with k modes clustering. The findings provide a new level of granular insight into Islamophobic behaviour amongst the far right on social media, both deepening existing knowledge and informing policy discussions regarding far right extremism and online hate speech.\",\n",

The algorithm has been validated against 4 additional distinct datasets from different countries using multimodal test results to define glaucoma rather than just the OCT alone.   2076 OCT (Cirrus SD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) cube scans centered over the optic nerve, of 879 eyes (390 healthy and 489 glaucoma) from 487 patients, age 18-84 years, were exported from the Glaucoma Clinic Imaging Database at the Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, from March 2010 to December 2017. A 3D deep neural network was trained and tested on this unique OCT optic nerve head dataset from Stanford. A total of 3620 scans (all obtained using the Cirrus SD-OCT device) from 1458 eyes obtained from 4 different institutions, from United States (943 scans), Hong Kong (1625 scans), India (672 scans), and Nepal (380 scans) were used for external evaluation.   The 3D deep learning system achieved an area under the receiver operation characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.8883 in the primary Stanford test set identifying true normal from true glaucoma. The system obtained AUROCs of 0.8571, 0.7695, 0.8706, and 0.7965 on OCT cubes from United States, Hong Kong, India, and Nepal, respectively.   We also analyzed the performance of the model separately for each myopia severity level as defined by spherical equivalent and the model was able to achieve F1 scores of 0.9673, 0.9491, and 0.8528 on severe, moderate, and mild myopia cases, respectively.

While lifelog data has been put to use in various contexts, its application to indoor environment scenario remains unexplored. In this proposal, I plan to design a method that enables us to capture and record indoor lifelog data of a person\\'s life in order to facilitate healthcare systems, emergency response, item tracking etc. To this end, we aim to build an Indoor Information Retrieval system that can be queried with natural language queries over lifelog data.

In this paper we promote the idea that the \\\\emph{context} determined by the modifiers plays a major role, and the context itself determines not only the causes but also what causality should be. Modifiers are then used to understand when an event (or a set of events) can be added to a configuration, together with a set of events modeling dependencies, which will play a less important role.

To this end, we first optimize the number and locations of cluster heads (CHs) guaranteeing data collection from all sensors. Then, to minimize the data collection flight time, we optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. Accordingly, we distinguish two trajectory approaches: 1) where a UAV hovers exactly above the visited CH; and 2) where a UAV hovers within a range of the CH. The results of this include guidelines for data collection design. The characteristics of sensor nodes' K-means clustering are then discussed. Next, we illustrate the performance of optimal and heuristic solutions for trajectory planning. The genetic algorithm is shown to be near-optimal with only $3.5\\\\%$ degradation. The impacts of the trajectory approach, environment, and UAVs' altitude are investigated. Finally, fairness of UAVs trajectories is discussed.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Social epistemologists have argued that high risk, high reward science has an important role to play in scientific communities. Recently, though, it has also been argued that various scientific fields seem to be trending towards conservatism -- the increasing production of what Kuhn (1970) would have called `normal science'. This paper will explore a possible explanation for this sort of trend: that the process by which scientific research groups form, grow, and dissolve might be inherently hostile to high risk science. In particular, I employ a paradigm developed by Smaldino and McElreath (2016) that treats a scientific community as a population undergoing selection. As will become clear, perhaps counter-intuitively this sort of process in some ways promotes high risk, high reward science. But, as I will point out, high risk high reward science is, in general, the sort of thing that is hard to repeat. While more conservative scientists will be able to train students capable of continuing their successful projects, and so create thriving lineages, successful risky science may not be the sort of thing one can easily pass on. In such cases, the structure of scientific communities selects against high risk, high rewards projects. More generally, this paper makes clear that there are at least two processes to consider in thinking about how incentives shape scientific communities -- the process by which individual scientists make choices about their careers and research, and the selective process governing the formation of new research groups.\",\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used to model the underlying probability distribution of sample based datasets. GANs are notoriuos for training difficulties and their dependence on arbitrary hyperparameters. One recent improvement in GAN literature is to use the Wasserstein distance as loss function leading to Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs). Using this as a basis, we show various ways in which the Wasserstein distance is estimated for the task of generative modelling. Additionally, the secrets in training such models are shown and summarized at the end of this work. Where applicable, we extend current works to different algorithms, different cost functions, and different regularization schemes to improve generative models.',\n",
